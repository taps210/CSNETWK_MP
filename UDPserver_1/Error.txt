1. When you store a file that doesn't exist, the program will try to make it in the server folder, after that the program does not respond anymore
- Status: Fixed
2. Leave is glitchy (If person join, then leave, can't rejoin)
- Status: Brute Forced, join has try except, but the except block is blank so it diesnt send error line

3. Test Demo Kit
- C2 Failed, BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
- C3 Failed, OSError: [Errno 57] Socket is not connected
- D3 Failed, seems to occur when /dir is after a blank /join
    - Fixed, Same solution as the 1. where used tru and flase statement to check to receive messages or not
- E2 Failed, After doing /register without arguements, fail to accept inputs
    - Fixed
- F5 failed???, unsure if avif file is the issue, or the sequence leading to F5 made it fail, this is the error
    -File "C:\Users\hanzp\OneDrive\Desktop\CSNETWK\CSNETWK_MP\UDPserver_1\UDPserver.py", line 113, in handle_client
        print("Data:" + data.decode())
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
