1. When you store a file that doesn't exist, the program will try to make it in the server folder, after that the program does not respond anymore
- Status: Fixed
2. Leave is glitchy (If person join, then leave, can't rejoin)
- Status: Brute Forced, join has try except, but the except block is blank so it diesnt send error line

3. Test Demo Kit
- C2 Failed, BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
- C3 Failed, OSError: [Errno 57] Socket is not connected
- D3 Failed, seems to occur when /dir is after a blank /join
    - Fixed, Same solution as the 1. where used tru and flase statement to check to receive messages or not
